THEORY OF OPERATION:  Wells Gardner "Quadrascan" Color X-Y Monitor

CAUTION!!! LETHAL VOLTAGES ARE PRESENT IN THIS MONITOR, IF YOU HAVE ANY
 DOUBTS  ABOUT YOUR ABILITY DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REPAIR YOUR MONITOR!!

The "Quadrascan" color X-Y display was designed and built by Wells Gardner 
Electronics Corp. This display differs VERY LITTLE from the Electrohome G-05
Black and White X-Y monitor. The only difference is that this monitor has 
three Z amplifiers to control three color guns.  Refer to the G-05 theory 
if there is any confusion on operating principles.

LOW VOLTAGE POWER SUPPLY

	The input voltage of 48 VAC from the game power supply enters through 
fuses F100 and F101.  Diodes D100 through D104 form a rectifier bridge that 
converts the AC input to an unfiltered DC (about 35V).  Capacitors C100 and 
C101 form the first stage of filtering.  Resistors R102 and R103 and 
capacitors C102 and C103 form two low-pass filters  which help filter out 
AC ripple.  Transistors Q100 through Q103 form and active filter that 
provides the stable, filtered DC voltages.
	The degaussing coil operates when power is first applied to the 
display, when the PTP(positive temperature coefficient) thermistor is cool. 
Diodes D106 and D107 form a protective barrier from any residual current 
that might enter the degaussing coil during normal game play.  The output 
voltages from the low voltage power supply should be as follows:
				J101-2	ground
				J101-3	+25 volts
				J101-4	-25 volts

	The picture tube filament voltage is taken from the front end of the 
low-voltage power supply through D108 and R107.

X AND Y AMPLIFIERS

	Both the X and Y amps are nearly identical. Only the Y amp is 
described.  

	The Y deflection signal from the game board is applied to the base 
circuit of transistor Q600.  Transistors Q600 and Q601 form a differential 
amplifier.  Transistor Q602 is a constant current source providing current 
to the differential amplifier.  Transistor Q603 is the driver transistor 
that provides current to the emitter-follower transistors Q605 and Q606.  
Transistor Q604 is a constant current source that provides current to the 
driver transistor Q603.  Fuse F600 can open in case of circuit failure, 
protecting the deflection coil in the yoke from damage.

Z AMPLIFIERS

	Since the red, green and blue amplifiers are identical, only the blue 
amplifier will be described.

	Transistor Q502 is a common emitter amplifier used to provide gain 
for the blue intensity signal. Resistor R509 is the blue drive pot which 
determines the amount of gain in the blue amplifier.  Resistor R513 is the 
blue bias pot which determines the cut-off characteristics of the blud 
amplifier.  The output of the Z amplifiers bias the cathodes of the three 
electron guns within the picture tube.
	Transistor Q503 is biased by a voltage from the spot killer.  When 
transistor Q503 is cut off, the collector of Q503 rises to the zener voltage
of ZD500 (+4.3V).  This allows the emitter of transistor Q502 to rise in 
voltage, which disables the color signals to the picture tube.

SPOT KILLER

	The purpose of the spot killer is to turn off the video intendity 
amplifiers when deflection is not occurring.  Failure of the spot killer 
can cause the phosphor coating on the picture tube to become burned.
	The two signal input voltages to the spot killer are taken from 
resistors R610 and R710  in the X and Y deflection circuits.  Diodes D801 
through D804 and Capacitors C800 through C803 form two seperate voltage 
doublers.  The output of the voltage doublers are applied to the bases of 
transistors Q801 and Q802.
	When either of the deflection amplifiers is not driving current 
through the deflection coils, then either transistor Q801 or Q802 becomes 
biased so that it conducts, which turns on transistor Q800 and the 
LED D800 in its collector circuit.  When transistor Q800 is conducting, 
then transistor Q503 in the neck PCB is cut off, forcing the red, green 
and blue amplifiers to turn off their electron beams.

HIGH VOLTAGE POWER SUPPLY

	Integrated circuit IC901 is a timer circuit that produces a 20KHz 
output which drives transistors Q904 and Q905.  These transistors are 
current amplifiers that drive the primary winding of the Step down 
transformer T901.  The output of T901 is used to turn on the main driver 
transistor Q906 that in turn drives the High Voltage Step-up transformer 
T900.  The output of the secondary winding is applied to the picture tube 
at the focus and intensity grids and the 19.5KV anode.
	Diode D901 allows capacitor C910 to charge to +180V during the 
discharge of the primary's magnetic field.  Transistors Q900 through Q903 
are error amplifiers that regulate the +180V video B+.  Pot R918 provides 
an adjustment to the video B+ and hence the high voltage.
	To adjust the high voltage, you will need a high voltage probe, a 
voltmeter, and an insulated screwdriver tipped adjustment tool.  Turn off 
power to the display.  Connect the high-voltage probe to to the voltmeter, 
and insert the tip of the probe under the high voltage anode rubber shield.
	Insert the insulated screwdriver tipped adjustment tool through the 
top of the high voltage cage, making contact with potentionmeter R918.  
Turn on the display and adjust  the high voltage to 19.5KV.
