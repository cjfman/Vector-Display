                The Wells Gardner 19K6400 Color X/Y monitor
                                    or
                  Oh God, Not another color X/Y monitor!

Preface:
   Twas the autumn of the First year, the devine beginning for some, when
out from abbyss of B&W came to be the 19K6100... and it was seen as good.
Well, sort of. It was then, mere months later, out of the fell darkness, there
came to be wrought the dread G-08 and a great hew and cry was heard fall from
the tongues of the embittered worshipers of the X/Y. Amidst the babble and
throng was heard the call "Where's that damnable fire extinguisher?".
   Of the false saviour, the spawn of the Disciples of Amplifone, whose
name shall not be uttered, nought is written, for it was a twisted beast
whose heart was oft consumed in fire.
   It then came to pass that the exhaulted Engineers of WG did bend Thier
will and thought to bring forth into being a new X/Y monitor whose very
heart and sinew was taken from it's most highest parent, the K6100. After the
Blessed Engineer's most arduous toil had ended They rested and did look down
upon that which They had brought into being and Thier hearts did soar and near
burst with gladness. Rejoicing, They were heard to proclaim in blinding
voices which reverberated in to the Heavens...
   
                         "BEHOLD, THE 19K6400".

;-)

  OK, seriously, if your like me you've heard of the Wells Gardner 19K6101/2,
the Electrohome G-08 and the Amplifone (whatever) and probably worked on a
few too. You also probably read Gregg Woodcock's EXCELLENT write up on them.
If you haven't read the latest version of it (6.1) do so. Highly recommended!
In this document are mentions of some revisions of the deflection, Hi-V and
neck boards; boards numbered P322, P324 and P341, respectively. There are
also hints at a model called the 19K6400. Since I had never seen a 6400 I
had assumed that it was similar to the 6100 series and the boards would be
swappable. It turns out that they are not.
  The 19K6401 and 6402 are very similar to it's predecessor but there are some
important differences. First, and most important, is the fact that they are
NOT plug compatible, physically or electrically. The main connector is only
12 pins, not 15. The RGB and associated returns are on this connector, as is
the filament voltage and the AC input voltage. The X and Y signals come in on
a seperate 4 position connector. The X,Y and RGB signals are the same as the
6100 series but the AC input voltage is +/- 40 VAC, not +/- 25VAC!
  Looking at the monitor you'd also notice that the power transistors for
the X and Y deflection circuits are gone. They are no longer mounted to the
chassis. Instead there are four vertically mounted aluminum heat sinks between
the high voltage cage and the deflection board. There are also twice as many
power transistors as before (more on this below).
  The other physical differences are unimportant and won't be mentioned here
except to say that the Hi-V cage is 'connector-ized' differently. The real
differences can be found by looking at the schematics. I'll cover the changes
(read improvements) in the circuits for each board separately.

---------------------  ELECTRICAL SPECIFICATIONS ------------------------------

  First here's a comparison of specifications taken from the manuals for both

Due to the minimal specs for the 6100's writing rate you can't really
do a true comparison on the relative speeds.

-------------------  CIRCUIT COMPONENT COMPARISON ------------------------

This section describes the differences in the actual components in the two
monitors. The PC boards themselves are different to allow for the two new
connectors on the deflection board assembly, the brightness control parts
on the neck board and the slightly different power connector for the Hi-V
board.

Unless otherwise noted: all resistors are 1/4 Watt 5% Tolerance,
                        all capacitor values in uF (microfarads)

I) P322 - THE DEFLECTION / DC VOLTAGE / SPOT KILLER BOARD -----------------

a) DC voltage Supply

  For the most part the design of this board is similar to the P327 board.
Here the supply was designed to output +/-47 VDC where it use to be +/- 28V.

c) Deflection Amps
  The design of this section is mostly the same. The difference is in the
transistors Q605,606,705,706. Each of these is replaced with A PAIR of
transistors and two low resistance emitter resistors. These are now mounted on
large (~4" X 4") aluminum finned heat sinks.

Circuit change
In an effort to decouple the delfection pre-drivers from the power drivers
the circuit has been changed here slightly. Note the absence of R613 & R712.

The deflection power transistors, as mentioned above, are now two transistors
with thier bases connected together and thier collectors connected together.
Each emitter is connected to a 0.39ohm 1W 5% resistor with the other ends of
the resistor tied together. Collectors and bases are connected as before and
the resistors are now connected to where the emitter use to be on the 6100.
Each transistor pair is now mounted on a hefty (~4" x 4") aluminum finned
heatsink. The four heatsink assemblies are stacked together and are mounted to
the chassis between the Hi-V cage and the deflection board.

The RCA picture tube 19VLTP22 is used in the 19K6402 model monitor and requires
the WG #9A2825-001 deflection yoke. The Rauland picture tube, type 19VNJP22,
which is used in the model 19K6401, requires a 9A2819-001 yoke.

d) Degauss Circuit 
P.T.C.,D106,D107,C106 - unchanged
R106              22ohm 2W 10%           22ohm 3W 10%

II) P324 - THE HIGH VOLTAGE BOARD --------------------------------------------

IMHO, this change alone makes the monitor 2X as reliable as it's predecessor.
In the original design, if one side of the power supply died, which it often
did, there was a fair chance that the Hi-V circuit could be over-stressed. I'm
not implying that this was the major cause of failures, just one of them. In
the 6400 design the Hi-V module is powered by +48VDC. There are very few other
differences in the design.

Component value changes (components not mentioned remain unchanged)
                  19K610x (P316)         19K640x (P324)

C901              100uF 35V              100uF 100V
C902              100uF 35V              SHORT (note 1)
C905              33uF 150V              33uF 63V
R901              2.2ohm 2W 5%           3.9ohm 3W 10%
R907              2.2ohm 2W 5%           UNUSED

Note 1 - By shorting out capacitor C902 what use to be B- is now GND.

III) P341 - THE NECK BOARD ----------------------------------------------------

At first glance the P341 looks very much like the P315. Comparing the CRT
socket pinouts, however, shows otherwise. The 19VLTP22 pinout is very different
from the 19VLUP22. While physically you could plug the P341 in place of a 315;
all the connectors would fit, you'd probably destroy both board and tube. 

Component value changes (components not mentioned remain unchanged)
                  19K610x (P315)         19K640x (P341)

ZD501             ZENER 13V 1W 5%        18V 1W 5%
C503              33uF 250V              2.2uF 350V
R525              3.3M 1/2W 10%          22M 1/2W
R526              510ohm 1W              1K 2W
R527              470ohm 1/2W            33ohm 1/2W

Circuit change -
Capacitors C500-502 are now connected to the wipers of R507-509.
The brightness control circuit is made up of an additional four resistors,
one potentiometer and a cap.

IV) P325 INTERFACE & IPC BOARD ------------------------------------------------

This is a new board which accepts the X & Y signals along with +/- 40VDC and
output modified X & Y signals. The first stage of the board is an adjustable
gain circuit with a nominal value of X2. The next stage provides input 
protection for the deflection amplifiers. Lastly there is linearity and
centering adjustments. It's not clear from the manual just where the board is
actually located but it sounds as if it plugs directly into two new connectors
on the deflection board (P602 and P702) and is at a right angle to it. Doesn't
sound like it's very easy to get at the pots.

---------------------------  SUMMARY  ----------------------------------------

I'm posting this article simply to distribute information that's not widely
available. The 19K640x has obvious improvements over the 19K610x but I'm not
trying to say that it's a better monitor overall. I have no idea if WG had
intended this to be the next generation color X/Y monitor or if it was a 
response to Electrohome's G08. It obviously wasn't widely used. The only game
that I know used it is Aztarac and we know how many of those there are ;-)

You're probably wondering if some of the improvements could be used to upgrade
our beloved K610x's. The answer is a resounding 'Maybe'. The three major
improvements, I think, are: the dual deflection transistors, the Hi-V supply's
unipolar supply input and the new Interface board (Very handy if this display
were to be used with the Sega stuff). The method of transistor heatsinking
could definitely be applied but it's up in the air whether the dual XSTR
design can be applied (I'm leaning toward a yes here). The Interface board
could certianly be used but without a PC board it would be too much work to
make. Lastly, the Hi-V supply mod is probably not possible. However if one was
to use an external 48V supply...
